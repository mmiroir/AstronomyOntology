# Astronomy Ontology
## What is AO?
This is an attempt at an open source ontology using Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) as its base structure. It is intended to represent the elements of our physical universe from the perspective and granularity of the study of astronomy. This project is at an initial stage of development. Any feedback or subject matter expertise appreciated.
