# TO DO

- upload relationships
- resolve brown dwarf issues
- storm process parts 
- pulsing star pulses exist in a 1D temporal region
- apply allen's process algebra for stellar evolution and universe life
- asteroid belt - what is it? is it a spatial region? or an object aggregate?


- Add in hemisphers and poles

Additional Classes
- habitable zone - 3D space
- habitable zone boundary - surface (fiat?)

role
- satellite
- moon
- planet
- vehicle
- light source
- home?

Process
- burn
- cool
- explode
- orbit
- collapse
- expand
- pulse (decrease in luminosity + increase in luminosity)
- stellar evolution (has different paths for different stars)
